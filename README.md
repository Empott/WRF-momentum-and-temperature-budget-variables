# WRF-momentum-and-temperature-budget-variables
This repository contains all the WRF modifications to output the momentum budget variables used in "Dynamical drivers of the local wind regime in a Himalayan valley". 
These modifications are adapted from those used by N. Moisseeva: https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/download/pdf/33426/1.0107646/1
The document above also contains clear instructions on how to use the modified WRF code.
